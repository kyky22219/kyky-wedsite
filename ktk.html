    <h1>food from Cameroon></h1> 
<p>In Cameroon, there is a very wide variety of culinary preparations and multiple regional traditions, so much so that it is difficult to speak of Cameroonian cuisine as a unified whole. There are many regional dishes that have developed to the point of being recognized nationally and internationally such as DG chicken or ndol√©. Many regional dishes, originally, have also multiplied across the country with some variations from one region to another.
The variety of the country's cuisine is explained by the diversity of its ethnic groups, by its history which has brought diverse culinary influences, and by its contrasting climate which gives access to different plant and animal products depending on the climate in these regions. .</p>
